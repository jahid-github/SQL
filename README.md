# SQL Practice & Cheat Sheet (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

*SQL is a programming language used to interact with relational databases.*
*It is used to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.*

### **What is data?**
*Data is raw, unprocessed facts and figures collected from different sources. It can be numbers, text, images, or symbols that by itself has no clear meaning until analyzed.*

### **What are the differences between data and information?**
| **Data**               | **Information**                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Raw, unprocessed facts | Processed, organized, and meaningful data |
| Example: `23, 45, 67`  | Example: "The average score is 45"        |
| Has no direct meaning  | Has meaning, helps in decision-making     |
| Input for processing   | Output of processing                      |

“Data is the raw material, and information is the finished product that gives meaning to the data.”

### **What is a database engineer?**

*A Database Engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and manages databases to make sure data is stored safely, organized efficiently, and retrieved quickly. They act like architects of data systems—ensuring the right structure, performance, and security so that businesses can make smart use of their information.*

- **Database:** *An organized collection of related data.*
- **Entities:** Real-world objects we store data about (e.g., Student, Course).
- **Relationships:** Associations between entities (e.g., John ENROLLED in Database course).
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** Software to create, store, update, and query databases. **(Provides security, consistency, and controlled access. *Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.*)**

### **Types of Databases**
1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
- Data stored in tables (rows & columns).
- Use SQL for querying.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
- Used in banking and university systems.

2. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases – non-relational
- Flexible, schema-less, handles big & unstructured data.
- Data not stored in tables.
- Data can be stored as: documents, graphs, key-value pairs
- Used in social media, recommendation systems

### **Database Users**
*Database users can be broadly grouped into two categories:*

**- Actors on the Scene (directly interact with the database)**
  
1. Database administrators - Control and monitor database use.
*Responsibilities:*
- Authorize access (who can read/write).
- Set up backups and recovery.
- Ensure security.
- 
2. Database Designers - Decide what data will be stored and how it will be organized.
*Responsibilities:*
- Define tables, relationships, and constraints.
- Design the ER model and schema.
- Ensure the database supports business requirements.

3. End-Users - The largest group — people who actually use the data.
*For example:*
- Naïve users → use standard applications (e.g., bank clerk).
- Sophisticated users → Sophisticated users like engineers or analysts interact directly with the database using SQL queries.

**- Workers Behind the Scene (don’t use the data directly, but make DBMS possible)**

- DBMS system developers → build the database engine itself.
- Tool developers → build utilities like MySQL Workbench
- Computer system operators → manage servers, hardware, and OS where DB runs.
- Maintenance staff → update, optimize DBMS software.


**Manipulating a Database**
- Querying → retrieve specific information (e.g., list all students in a course).
- Updating → insert, delete, modify records. e.g., Add/delete or update student information.
- Reporting → generate summaries and insights (e.g., average grades, monthly sales).

**Database engineer roles and responsibilities:**
1. Design and Implementation
2. Normalization
3. Optimization
4. Backup and Recovery
5. Security
6. Data Migration
7. Integration
8. Capacity Planning
9. Documentation
10. Testing and QA
11. Reporting

*ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability*

### DBMS Data Models

A **data model** in DBMS is a framework used to define how data is structured, stored, and managed. It helps in bridging the gap between real-world data requirements and the internal structure of a database.
**Purpose of Data Modeling**
- To understand the data requirements of a system.
- To define entities (things), their attributes (properties), and relationships (connections).


**Layers of Data Modeling**

| Level | Purpose | Examples / Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Conceptual (High-level)** | Captures business semantics & requirements | Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, entities, attributes, relationships |
| **Logical (Representational)** | Defines the logical structure independent of DBMS | Relational model: tables, relational algebra/calculus |
| **Physical** | Specifies how data is stored in the DBMS | Tables, indexes, data types, storage, file structures, access paths |

**Other Data Models**

- **Hierarchical Model** — tree-like parent-child data structure  
- **Network Model** — supports many-to-many relationships  
- **Object-Oriented Model** — data as objects with attributes and methods  
- **Float Model** — 2D array representation, limited scalability  
- **Context Model** — composite of multiple models  
- **Semi-Structured Model** — flexible schema (e.g. XML, JSON)

**Advantages:**
1. Accurate and clear representation of data  
2. Helps avoid redundancy, identify missing data  
3. Supports constraints, relationships, and security  
4. Provides a roadmap for implementing the database  

**Disadvantages:**
1. Complexity in large databases  
2. Requires deep DBMS / storage knowledge  
3. Structural changes can ripple across the system  
4. No universal data manipulation language  
5. Good modeling needs knowledge of physical storage constraints   

**Degree of a Relationship**
*Definition: Number of entity types that participate in a relationship.*
- Unary (degree 1): Relationship within the same entity (e.g., Employee manages Employee).
- Binary (degree 2): Between two entities (e.g., Student enrolls in Course).
- Ternary (degree 3): Among three entities (e.g., Doctor prescribes Medicine to Patient).

**Cardinality in Relationships**
*Definition: Specifies how many instances of one entity can/must be associated with instances of another entity.*
- One-to-One (1:1): Each Student has one Locker.
- One-to-Many (1:N): One Instructor teaches many Courses.
- Many-to-Many (M:N): Students enroll in many Courses, and each Course has many Students.

### ER-to-Relational Mapping Algorithm
- Step 1: Mapping of Regular Entity Types 
- Step 2: Mapping of Weak Entity Types 
- Step 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relation Types 
- Step 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types
- Step 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types
- Step 6: Mapping of Multivalued attributes

## Relational Integrity Constraints Structured Query Language (SQL)
*Constraints are conditions that must be true on all valid tuples. These conditions are called Relational Integrity Constraints. 
There are three main types of constraints:* 
1. Key constraints 
- Every relation in the database should have at least one set of attributes which defines a tuple uniquely. Those set of attributes is called key.
- If there are more than one, these are called candidate keys. 
- Primary Key: A candidate key that is chosen to uniquely identify each tuple in the relation. 
- The primary key attributes are underlined. 
- Choose as primary key the smallest of the candidate keys (in terms of size). 
- A primary key has two properties: It should be unique for all tuples and It can’t have NULL values.

2. Entity integrity constraints 
- Entity Integrity: The primary key attributes of each relation cannot have null values in any tuple of a relation. *(No attribute participating in the primary key is allowed to accept null values.)*
- Note: Other attributes of the relation may be similarly constrained to disallow null values, even though they are not members of the primary key. 

3. Referential integrity constraints 
*(These constraints are checked before performing any operation (insert, delete and update) in database. If there is a violation in any of constraints, operation will fail.)*


## **Row-Oriented DB**

* Stores data **row by row**.
* Best for **transactions (OLTP-Online transaction processing)**.
* **Fast for writes & updates**.
* Slower for analytics (must read all columns).
* Examples: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle**.

## **Column-Oriented DB**

* Stores data **column by column**.
* Best for **analytics (OLAP-Online Analytical Processing)**.
* **Fast for aggregations & queries** on few columns.
* Slower for frequent writes.
* Examples: **Redshift, BigQuery, ClickHouse**.

✅ **Rule of thumb:**

* **Row DB → good for many small transactions.**
* **Column DB → good for analyzing large datasets.**

## 1. Connect / Select Database

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- show databases
SHOW DATABASES;

-- create database
CREATE DATABASE school;

-- use database
USE school;
``` | ```sql
-- show databases
SELECT name FROM sys.databases;

-- create database
CREATE DATABASE school;

-- use database
USE school;
``` |

---

## 2. Create Table

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  first_name  VARCHAR(50),
  last_name   VARCHAR(50),
  age         INT
);
``` | ```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name  VARCHAR(50),
  last_name   VARCHAR(50),
  age         INT
);
``` |

🔎 Difference:  
- **MySQL** → `AUTO_INCREMENT`  
- **SQL Server** → `IDENTITY(1,1)`

---

## 3. Alter / Drop / Truncate

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- add column
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

-- drop column
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN email;

-- delete only rows
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- drop table
DROP TABLE employees;
``` | ```sql
-- add column
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);

-- drop column
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN email;

-- delete only rows
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- drop table
DROP TABLE employees;
``` |

## 4. Insert / Update / Delete (DML)

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- insert
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ('Mary', 'Doe', 28);

-- update
UPDATE employees
SET age = 29
WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- delete
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;
``` | ```sql
-- insert
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ('Mary', 'Doe', 28);

-- update
UPDATE employees
SET age = 29
WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- delete
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;
``` |

## 5. Select / Filter / Sort / Group

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- basic select
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;

-- filter
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;

-- order
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY age DESC;

-- group
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
``` | ```sql
-- basic select
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;

-- filter
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;

-- order
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY age DESC;

-- group
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
``` |

## 6. Joins

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- inner join
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- left join
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;
``` | ```sql
-- inner join
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- left join
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;
``` |

📌 Note: SQL Server supports `FULL OUTER JOIN` directly; MySQL emulates it with `UNION` (like in PDF). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 7. String Functions

| MySQL (typical) | SQL Server (T-SQL) |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| ```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  UPPER(first_name) AS upper_name,
  LOWER(last_name) AS lower_name,
  LENGTH(first_name) AS name_len
FROM employees;
``` | ```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  UPPER(first_name) AS upper_name,
  LOWER(last_name) AS lower_name,
  LEN(first_name) AS name_len
FROM employees;
``` |

📝 Differences:
- MySQL → `LENGTH()` / `CHAR_LENGTH()`
- SQL Server → `LEN()`
- Common ones from PDF: `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`, `TRIM` :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 8. Date & Time

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
SELECT
  CURRENT_DATE()      AS today,
  CURRENT_TIME()      AS now_time,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS now_ts,
  DATE_ADD('2025-10-30', INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS t_plus_1,
  DATEDIFF('2025-10-30', '2025-10-29')   AS diff_days;
``` | ```sql
SELECT
  CAST(GETDATE() AS date)       AS today,
  CAST(GETDATE() AS time)       AS now_time,
  GETDATE()                     AS now_dt,
  DATEADD(DAY, 1, '2025-10-30') AS t_plus_1,
  DATEDIFF(DAY, '2025-10-29', '2025-10-30') AS diff_days;
``` |

## 9. Conditional Logic

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
SELECT
  total_amount,
  CASE
    WHEN total_amount > 1000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN total_amount > 500  THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS order_status,
  IF(total_amount > 500, 'VIP', 'REGULAR') AS cust_type
FROM orders;
``` | ```sql
SELECT
  total_amount,
  CASE
    WHEN total_amount > 1000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN total_amount > 500  THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS order_status,
  IIF(total_amount > 500, 'VIP', 'REGULAR') AS cust_type
FROM orders;
``` |

📌 PDF shows `CASE`, `IF()`, `COALESCE()` – in SQL Server `IIF()` plays a similar role. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## 10. Transactions

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, age)
VALUES ('Alice', 30);

UPDATE products
SET price = 25
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
``` | ```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, age)
VALUES ('Alice', 30);

UPDATE products
SET price = 25
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
``` |

(From PDF transaction control) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## 11. Users / Permissions (basic)

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- create user (simple)
CREATE USER 'islam'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPass123';

-- grant
GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON school.*
TO 'islam'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
``` | ```sql
-- create login
CREATE LOGIN islam
WITH PASSWORD = 'StrongPass123';

-- create user in db
USE school;
CREATE USER islam FOR LOGIN islam;

-- grant
GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON dbo.employees TO islam;
``` |

PDF shows generic `GRANT` / `REVOKE` which maps to both. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## 12. Show Tables / Describe Table

| MySQL | SQL Server |
|-------|------------|
| ```sql
-- show all tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- describe structure
DESCRIBE employees;
``` | ```sql
-- list tables
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE';

-- describe columns
EXEC sp_help 'dbo.employees';
-- or
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'employees';
``` |
